      <h1>What is EQ & IQ?</h1>
        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            It is the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions of yourself and others. This can be measured using self-report tests and ability tests. Self report tests are the easiest and most commonly used. A question could look like “I can often read a crowd” and the answers are usually something along the lines of these options: disagree, somewhat disagree, agree, or strongly agree. The answer may also be in the form of a scale like 1-100, often a slider bar.Ability tests are done in an environment where you are able to use the skills and then scored, usually by a psychologist. There are around 4 different levels of EQ:

              <LI>Emotional Perception- This involves understanding nonverbal signals such as body language and facial expressions. 
              <LI>Reasoning with Emotions - promotes thinking and cognitive activity, prioritising focus solely on the task at hand and how we respond emotionally to things that need out attention. 
              <LI>Understanding Emotions - is what we perceive of emotions. If someone is sad it’s knowing why and what it means. Maybe you did something to upset them or they have problems at home or it could have been a relationship breakup. 
              <LI>Managing Emotions - is the most crucial and highest level. You need to be able to regulate your emotions and respond well to other people’s emotions.

            Emotional intelligence is best taught from an early age but, to a limited extent, can be enhanced as an adult.

        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
          <p>
            Intellectual Quotient is the ability of solving problems, learning, using logical reasoning, word comprehension and grasping or communicating complex ideas. Your IQ result is a number but also tested from standardised assessments. IQ is usually genetic but can broadened through brain food and mental ability exercises such as puzzles and problem solving techniques that makes you think outside the box.
          </p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
          <p>
            Those with a higher EQ have a better success rate in the workplace as they tend to make great leaders, team players and can work by themselves. They can understand, empathise and connect with people around them which, in any work environment, so you can communicate, listen and understand complicated situations that arise.
