    <h2>ETHICAL DECISION</h2>
    <p>I had been in a cafe job for about a month when my best friend (let's call her Alice) asked me to care for her grandmother (let's call her Elizabeth) in end of life care. But it meant giving up the job I had longed for, for so long. Finally being able to get into roasting coffee beans instead of just being on the cafe/restaurant floor. Which I had done for several years by then and being able to have the opportunity to change was huge for me. My friends dad (let's call him Ben) didn't want to put her in a care home as that was her wish and of course he has his own values. So they asked me to care for her. Not only did I have to leave my job, I had to move house to be a live in carer 24/7. I had only been in this house for a few months, with a family who cared very deeply for me. Who had helped me move out of home at 18, and treated and payed for things I couldn't afford, just like I was their own daughter. I looked my values such as independence, creativity and flexibility. I take the role of carer that is taken away from me. But I looked at my top values such as kindness, respect & happiness; I couldn't let Elizabeth spend her last few months in a care home against her wishes. So I quit my job and moved houses to live with and care for Elizabeth for the last 3 months of her life. It was rewarding, which I felt more afterwards, but also quite gruelling, especially without being able to sleep for more than 2 hours at a time. Unfortunately, because I had left a job so soon after joining and then had 3 months of essentially no work in my field, finding employment afterwards was quite challenging. I eventually did find a job in a restaurant but had lost the opportunity for something different. To this day I am still glad I took up such a big task as it showed me I can jump into something that I have no idea how to do but still push through all the obstacles and come out the other side with a new understanding of myself.</p>
    <h2>CULTURE</h2>
    <p>I grew up with my Mum, sister and Grandparents on the North Shore in Auckland, NZ. Dad left when I was 3. My Mum was born in Auckland along with my sister and I, but our father is from Bengal, India. Granddad was born in Portsmith, England and my Nana Hamilton, NZ. So I grew up with a Kiwi/English background. This is where my values of respect, independence, kindness, wealth, creativity, friends, honesty, happiness, flexibility, and dependability come from.</p>
    <p>These are some of my top strengths: leading a team, attentiveness, creativity, empathy, working in a team, multitasking, delegating, working in face paced environments, customer service, work under pressure. These I have found through working in hospitality and the music industry.</p>
    <p>I would say when learning something new, I struggle to stay focused and on task as I want to get to the finish line as quick as I can. I can also be too detail-focused and want to make things look too pretty or perfect.</p>
    <p>I think that all of my strengths can be used in my learning as they all have attributes that correspond to a learning environment. For example attentiveness and creativity are used in everyday programming, creating code but looking at all aspects of it in-depth. If we work in teams and we get stuck, I can think back and see how to resolve the issue. Maybe use delegating as well.</p>
    <p>I was managing a cafe with around 15 staff who all have very big personalities. When it would get busy, I would give everyone their own section/task to do so we had a smooth breakfast or lunch rush. But not everyone liked where I had put them and some would go off and jump on a section that already had a staff member at. This meant that one section would have no one doing anything at, causing several problems between the staff, me and customers. I would try reasoning with staff as to why I had put them on that section and listen actively as to why they had moved. This did work but next time I would rather ask what their preferred sections are and work with those than risk disrupting the staff and customers.</p>
