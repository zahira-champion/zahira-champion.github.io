    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p>So what is neuroplasticity? It’s physical changes that occur in the brain and adapt to your environment. The brain is continuously optimising how it functions in relation to our own way of thinking. This creates biological systems to strengthen our way of thinking, makes neural networks stronger while the unnecessary networks weaker, and enhances learning and memory. 
                Neuroplasticity is extremely important for human experiences. We could not function without it. There are 10 main principles of neuroplasticity:</p>
                <div>
                    <UL>
                        <LI>Use it or lose it: Neural networks become weak without repeated practice of a certain ability. You have now lost how, for example, to play an instrument. 
                        <LI>Use it and improve it: If you repeat the use of a certain brain function will enhance it, like learning a certain song or piece of music. 
                        <LI>Specificity: To help changes happen, they need to be targeted to a certain part of your brain in a specific way. 
                        <LI>Transference: Learning a skill somewhere can be transferred to a different situation.
                        <LI>Repetition: To learn a new skill requires a certain amount of repetition. 
                        <LI>Intensity: You are more likely to achieve results faster if you are training for long periods at a time and several times a week. 
                        <LI>Time: Changes in the brain happen at different points in training or learning a skill. 
                        <LI>Salience: You have to like the experience for any changes to be permanent.
                        <LI>Age: The younger you are the more likely you are to be able to change neural networks in your brain. 
                        <LI>Interference: Learning bad habits interfere with learning good habits.
                    </UL>
                </div>
            <p>You can use all of these principles for learning a new skill or recovering from an injury such as a stroke.
            </p>
            <p>To give you an example of using the 10 principles of neuroplasticity I just talked about, I will explain how I have used them for my own benefit. 
            Being a musician playing the viola, saxophone and cello, practise is basically my middle name. Viola being my first instrument, means that I have the strongest neural networks in this instrument from repeated, intense practice which enhances my memory for playing things. This is also the only instrument I play in a music group but that has some consequences. I end up practising the viola the most especially when we have new repertoire or a concert is coming up. That means I lose some of the skills I have when I’m playing the other two instruments as there is no constant repetition every week.
            </p>
            <p>There are a couple of different ways you can increase your neuroplasticity. One is through external change. From a young age we are wired to do certain things and this is reflected in our adulthood. But we can change these habits/routines though the following examples:
            </p>
            <div>
                <UL>
                    <LI>You could try something new such a learning a new language or taking up a sport.
                    <LI>Start using your non-dominant hand to do daily tasks with such as brushing your teeth or writing. 
                    <LI>Stop using a GPS to get to places, especially if you probably know the area but are unsure of yourself. Allow more time for your journey incase you get lost.  
                    <LI>Travel to new places to wake up your brain from auto pilot. Being surrounded by the same scenery means you are not fully aware of your actions.
                    <LI>Make new friends and talk to people face to face instead of on the phone.
                </UL>
            </div>
            <p>The second way is internally driven change:
            </p>
            <div>
                <UL>
                    <LI>Practise mindfulness which focuses on your mental health and your own awareness of yourself.
                    Meditation increases neuroplasticity as it decreases stress, anxiety and depression.
                    <LI>Meditation increases neuroplasticity as it decreases stress, anxiety and depression.
                    <LI>Having enough sleeping each night so everything important you have done that day is processed and stored to be used in the future.
                </UL>
            </div>
            <p>The brain is an incredible organ and if we take care of it, we can succeed at many things. 
            </p>

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p>Instead of looking at obstacles we can look at them at opportunities.  Instead of looking at our mistakes we can look at them as a chance to improve on our abilities. This is the basis of growth mindset. We go through several stages of development throughout our life and come across challenges that we have to solve in order to move on to the next stage. Though with these challenges comes the thought of failure when we can’t proceed. We think we aren’t capable of growing and developing which means we then proceed to just stop and not progress because the thought of failing again is painful. That’s where growth mindset can change that. It is a way of thinking, that you believe all your talents, intellect and skills can be further developed. People who think this way will tend to want to learn new skills while continuing to develop their current skill set. As I touched on at the beginning, those who have a growth mindset think of obstacles and failures as opportunities to grow.</p>
            <p>I would like to say I try to use growth mindset in my life as I am always looking for new things to try but I know I have a tendency to dwell on the failures. I know a few people who have an extremely sound awareness and solid growth mindset that they use daily which inspires me to try to not dwell on the the failures.</p>
            <p>The next couple of points are how I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey:
            </p>
            <div>
                <UL>
                    <LI>At the end of each day, I will reflect on the positives and achievements, even if small rather than dwelling on the not so successful parts of the day.
                    <LI>Tell myself that learning is full of mistakes and that is how you learn otherwise you aren’t learning.
                </UL>
            </div>
