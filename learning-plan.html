    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>Career Goals and Future Plan</h2>
            <p>My long term goal is too have a full time job coding in an office while also creating my own business for myself part-time. When/if I manage to create a worthwhile business, I would switch to doing that full-time and then being contracted out to do odd jobs for people depending on my workload. My music is a big part of my life, and this change of career into a pathway that is much more flexible long term, will make sure I don't miss out on big performances.</p>
        <h2>Strengths</h2>
            <p>I quite a creative mind and love putting that to use. This is something that will definitely come in handy in coding. I can problem solve and figure things out.</p>
        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
            <p>I am quite a perfectionist and when I create a plan/design in my head or on paper, I strive to achieve what is on there even if it's above my current skill set. I over work myself and find it hard to say no. This impacts my sleep and health as I will stay up until I complete the task that I had intended to. I can't always stay focused on the screen but I think that is due to what I was doing previously. I would be on my feet at work for about 12 hours a day so staring a screen and being still seems very unnatural to me.</p>
        <h2>Human Skills</h2>
            <p>I would like to work on putting myself first. I tend to make sure everyone around me has what they should first. But this means i've thought about what I want last and by then it's too late or i've run out of time. I would also like to get better at asking for help. I like to think I can do everything but it doesn't always work out that way.</p>
        <h2>Time Management</h2>
            <p>I will go over what is expected each week on a Monday morning and plan my time for the week on each task throughout the day. If I've under estimated myself I will try my best to get it all done. Otherwise I will ask other students and facilitators what I could be doing better. I am trying to limit my distractions around me as well.</p>
        <h2>Seeking Help</h2>
            <p>If I have been on a problem for too long I will ask on Slack or my coding friends for help. I have learnt from Sprint 2 that I shouldn't wait too long as there will always be more challenging tasks ahead.</p>
        <h2>Facilitation Team Expectation</h2>
            <p>I would like to have constructive feedback weekly from the check ins with my facilitator on things I could improve on but also things I seem to have a good grasp of and to not worry about them.</p>
        <h2>Extra-Curricular</h2>
            <p>I have orchestra weekly on Monday nights and I have to practice the music as well. I use that as my time away from the computer. I also like to go for motorbike rides if the weather permits.</p>
