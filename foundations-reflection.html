        <h2>Core Learning</h2>
          <p>
            Through the core learning, there are 3 things that stood out to me. The first one was properly learning how to use emotional intelligence. I had heard/read about it before but never put It into practise in my everyday life. I found learning about neuroplasticity super useful and how amazing the brain can be, how it can stretch and grow and take on new information. Even with this, I find myself lacking the confidence in myself to learn something when I’m stuck or blocked even though I know the brain is capable of so many wonderful things. I found growth mindset quite interesting and useful. I already seemed to have an understanding of growth mindset without realising what it actually meant. There are a couple of people around me often who use growth mindset daily so I am using that to help me further my daily life not just while studying.

        <h2>Values, Empathy and Self Awareness in Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Being able to be a team player is a huge part of programming but to do that you need an understanding of values, empathy and self awareness. These 3 things impact not just yourself but your coworkers and how they work with you.
          </p>
        <h2>Core Learning Surprises</h2>
          <p>
            I am quite surprised at how much core material we did but I can see why it is helpful. Understanding how the brain works and how you learn has quite an impact on your growth. In saying that I did feel like it was quite a lot of time to put into learning about it as I got quite behind in the tech side of things.
          </p>
        <h2>Core Learning Challenges </h2>
          <p>
            Learning about my values and identity was the hardest part, especially talking about my identity and how your upbringing has an effect on your choices.
          </p>
        <h2>EDA and Core Learning</h2>
          <p>
            I’m not sure I would say studying core was a waste of time but I do think that the amount of time put into it could have been less. The tech part is very time consuming plus you get stuck quite a lot and I did not stick to the time boxes at all really.  I would have felt I was making more progress faster if I hadn’t focused on core so much.
