                <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
                    <h2>Getting Blocked</h2>
                        <p>
                            In a nutshell, coding is basically problem solving. You are always working on ways to fix code or make new code and then ending up fixing bugs in the code you have just created. Because of this, I end up getting blocked quite a bit. Sometimes I work it out very quickly as it could have just been a spelling mistake as coding uses American English rather than British English. But sometimes it’s not a spelling mistake. This week we applied the javascript material we had learnt the previous week into challenges. One block I had took hours to solve, completing a challenge called FizzBuzz. I had gone over and over researching what a <mark>for loop</mark> was. For context a <mark>for loop</mark> is a statement that continues as long as the condition is true and stops once it becomes false. But at that point I hadn’t managed to understand it. One of the problems stemmed from the fact that I had studied for hours on end and every time I would read something, I was not able to process it as my brain had been working for too long and couldn’t take any more information in. My other problem was I didn’t understand what was being asked. I therefore wasn’t asking google the right questions and I just had to ask someone in the end. Super frustrating as that was most of my week but hopefully I get there soon.
                        </p>
                    <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
                        <p>
                            We use problem solving in everyday life. For example being stuck in traffic which is going to make you late for work. You’re probably thinking to yourself “Do I stay here or take my chances at another route?”. Another example is what to cook for dinner. I’m sure we all understand that dilemma. And in coding? Well we use it all the time. These next problem solving skills are some of the main ones including what they are, when and if I use them:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Pseudocode:</u> Before you start writing code you write out in plain english what you are going to do to solve the code. I try and use this to help understand the problem. When i’ve finished, I will change it and write out what I use to to solve it and an explanation incase I need to use it in the future and have forgotten what the code is doing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Trying something:</u> I think this technique explains itself. Hopefully in your everyday life you are trying things no matter how hard they seem. I always give everything a go! But half the time I don’t end up anywhere so I try something else to figure out the solution. There’s never any harm in trying!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Rubber ducky method:</u> Say you have a rubber duck sitting on your desk as a decoration. You could try to talk to it and explain what you are trying to solve to see if saying it outloud/explaining it has a difference. Personally, I talk to my cat Peanut. He’s usually keeping me company, sleeping by my chair. It does help sometimes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Reading error messages:</u> When you run code, it will come up with a message of saying if it worked or it failed. When it fails, it gives you a message as to why it failed. The message can be quite vague though so I don’t always find this helpful. Other times the message can be very clear and it’s a simple mistake of too many brackets or colons/semicolons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Console.logging:</u> This is used to print out messages in the console. It may include a string or object/s. I don’t feel like I have fully mastered how to use this which is frustrating as I know it would be a huge help. But I try regardless!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Googling:</u> Ahh! My best friend! I’m sure we all know what this does. And if not, well I’m sure you have typed in a question on a search engine such as “Is it going to rain today?”. In coding, if you are unsure of how to solve something google will most likely have an answer or can at least explain what a function that you are using does. This is my main go to problem solving technique and I usually have at least 10 tabs open.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Asking for help:</u> Now this is something a lot of people struggle with. I struggle with it as I have the mentality that I can do everything on my own. But in the end I usually always ask my friends for help as I feel that no one on slack really asks that many questions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Improving with reflection:</u> Reflection helps as you can look back at what you wrote, especially if you have forgotten something as you are more likely to understand how you write rather than the google. We write reflections as part of our curriculum but I don’t tend to write any others. I do put post it notes everywhere though.
