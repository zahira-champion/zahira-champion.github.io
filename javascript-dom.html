      <h1>Javascript and the DOM</h1>
        <h2>What are the differences between HTML and CSS?</h2>
          <p>
            When you think of a web page and the layout of that website, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two aspects used in web design. You must be thinking what are they? Simply, HTML is used to define the structure of a web page while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style it. You can think of it as building a house. HTML are the walls in a house, which is the structure of the website, and CSS is the paint on the house, which is the style of the website. Since you have gotten this far we can go a bit more indepth. HTML deals with coding titles, main text, photos, links in your text and several other components in a webpage. Now we have all the important text/information and links etc, you would like it to look nice. Font type, text size, text alignment and background colour are some of many things CSS does to create a nice looking web page. The CSS code is then linked to you HTML code.

        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
            <p>
              Control flow is the order in which the computer executes code. It runs in order from the first line of code to the last line unless it comes across if, if else statements or loops etc. Loops are an instruction that is repeated until a condition is met. It’s like a recipe or making scrambled eggs. You whisk until combined (a loop), put in a hot pan with oil, pour in the eggs, stirred around until cooked and then served. The recipe is control flow and whisking is a loop.
            </p>
        <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
            <p>
              The Document Object Model is a crucial part in web pages. It represents the browser as objects and code that make up the web page. It is similar to a text editor where you can change code and see the result immediately but it doesn’t alter anything permanently. The DOM is like a tree, HTML is the trunk and the branches are the elements.
            </p>
        <h2>What is the difference between acessesing data from arrays and objects?</h2>
            <p>
              Arrays are used to create lists of multiple items in one variable. You can also create arrays within arrays called nested arrays. Objects are used to represent something in your code like a boat, house, person, name or book. These are called properties and use <b>key</b> and a <b>value</b>.
            </p>
        <h2>What are functions?</h2>
            <p>
              They are reusable code that have a specific action such as performing a task or calculating a value. You can call on it over and over similar to looping where it is designed to perform a certain task you have like cooking eggs. Each part of cooking the eggs is a function.
